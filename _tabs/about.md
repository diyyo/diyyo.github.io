"Siesta" is a code name. Her main weapon is a musket gun while she also has "Seven Tools" that contain special powers. Siesta is one of the Twelve Tuners as the Great Detective.

Her real name, age, and nationality are unknown.<br><br>

Siesta means "nap" in Spanish, especially an afternoon one taken after lunch. It comes from the Latin word "sexta (hora) which mean "sixth (hour)". The Romans divided the daytime into twelve hours, so the sixth hour was the middle of the day, noon, the hour of maximum heat, a time when the Romans used to rest and sleep.</p>
